**Arto — the Art of Reading Markdown.**

---

Markdown has become more than a lightweight markup language — it's the medium for documentation, communication, and thinking in the developer's world.

While most tools focus on *writing* Markdown, **Arto is designed for *reading* it beautifully**.

> The name "Arto" comes from "Art of Reading" — reflecting the philosophy that reading Markdown is not just a utility task, but a quiet, deliberate act of understanding and appreciation.
